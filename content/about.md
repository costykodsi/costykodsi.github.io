I have been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University, Denmark, since August 2022. My time at Aalborg University has been both fulfilling and impactful, marked by several key achievements:

* __Secured Substantial Funding__: I instigated and spearheaded a project that successfully secured <u>10 million DKK (approximately 1.35 million USD)</u> in funding. This initiative aims to advance mathematical research in the maritime sector.

* __Recognition for Teaching Excellence__: In 2023, I was honoured to be voted <u>Teacher of the Year</u> by the students, a testament to my commitment to delivering high-quality education.

* __Founding the AAU MathSci Society__: I established the [AAU Mathematical Sciences (MathSci) Society](https://society.math.aau.dk/), which has become a platform for academic and professional engagement. The Society launched its inaugural issue of The Aalborg Mathematician magazine in 2024, available [here](https://prod-aaudxp-cms-001-app.azurewebsites.net/media/loepbclh/theaalborgmathematician.pdf).


My academic journey began at Imperial College London, where I graduated in 2007 with a M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering (a combined bachelor’s and master’s degree). Following this, I spent several years in industry, gaining practical experience that enabled me to qualify as a Chartered Engineer with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE).

In 2012, I pursued doctoral studies at the University of Glasgow, which marked the beginning of my transition into academia. Significant post-doctoral roles at the University of Manchester and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has steered my research towards more mathematical and data science-oriented applications.
