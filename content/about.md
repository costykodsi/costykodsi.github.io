I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University, Denmark. I took up my position in August 2022. My time at Aalborg University has been very rewarding:

* I __instigated__ a project securing __10 million DKK (approx 1.35 million USD)__ of funding. Please see https://www.math.aau.dk/department-of-mathematical-sciences-sets-sail-for-the-maritime-sector-n104844. 

* I was voted __Teacher of the Year__ by the students in 2023.

* I founded the [AAU Mathematical Sciences (MathSci) Society](https://society.math.aau.dk/). The Society published its first of the [Aalborg Mathematician](https://prod-aaudxp-cms-001-app.azurewebsites.net/media/loepbclh/theaalborgmathematician.pdf) magazine in 2024.



My journey in academia began at Imperial College. I graduated in 2007 with a M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering (the degree is a combined bachelor and masters). A number of years in industry followed, which provided me with the experience necessary to qualify as a Chartered Engineer with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). In 2012, I embarked on a doctorate at the University of Glasgow. Significant post-doctoral positions afterwards at the University of Manchester and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has seen my research become more mathematical and geared towards data science.
