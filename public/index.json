[{"content":"I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University, Denmark. I took up my position in August 2022. My time at Aalborg University has been very rewarding:\nI instigated a project bringing in 10 million DKK (approx 1.35 million USD) of funding. Please see https://www.math.aau.dk/department-of-mathematical-sciences-sets-sail-for-the-maritime-sector-n104844.\nI was voted Teacher of the Year by the students in 2023.\nI founded the AAU Mathematical Sciences (MathSci) Society. The Society published its first magazine in 2024, which is available at https://www.math.aau.dk/the-aalborg-mathematician-n119663.\nMy journey in academia began at Imperial College. I graduated in 2007 with a M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering (the degree is a combined bachelor and masters). A number of years in industry followed, which provided me with the experience necessary to qualify as a Chartered Engineer with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). In 2012, I embarked on a doctorate at the University of Glasgow. Significant post-doctoral positions afterwards at the University of Manchester and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has seen my research become more mathematical and geared towards data science.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Costy Kodsi","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Costy Kodsi","summary":"","title":"Costy Kodsi"},{"content":"Under construction!
